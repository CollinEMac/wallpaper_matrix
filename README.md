A pretty useless school project that takes an image of a set size and opens each piece of it in a different window

I think the only requirements for the project were to make something using openCV. 
Basically all this little script does it take a 1600x900 image and opens each segment of it in a different window.
The windows have some little filters added to them for fun.
To change the image just change the filename in line 12.

Requires cv2 and numpy.
